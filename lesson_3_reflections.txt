When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I'm satisfied with the changes and I want to publish it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might not want every change to get updated in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are used when cloning within Github from one account to another, clones are the copy of original Git repository done from Github to local system, and branches are making new commits but out of the track of original commit trail.
